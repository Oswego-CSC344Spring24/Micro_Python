# Micro_Python

Write a Python program which takes a single argument â€” a directory name. Your program will, for every file in the directory, count the number of lines in that file using the Unix command wc. Then, write to the console each file name and its number of lines.

## Submission requirements 
Please upload the following files to the GitHub repository.
1. your python source code
2. a screenshot of your code output
3. a screenshot showing all the files names in the directory you used.
